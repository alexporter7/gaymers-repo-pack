# MoreItems

by Jacob

Adds more valueables to multiplayer games. 

Works with mods that increase number of players and config UI mods.

Note: R.E.P.O. changes the base number of items based on the map and progression. This mod scales the base number of items.

## Default configuration

20% more items for each player over 4.

e.g.

* 1 player  - 20 items
* 2 players - 20 items
* 3 players - 20 items
* 4 players - 20 items
* 5 players - 24 items
* 6 players - 28 items
* ...
* 10 players - 44 items

## Custom configuration

* `Min Players` - The minimum number of players before MoreItems kicks in. `1` = works in single player. Default `5`.
* `Percentage` - The percentage to increase valuable count by per player. `0` = no extra items. `1` = 100% additional items per player. Default `0.2` (20% more items per player).

e.g.

When `MinPlayers` = `2` and `Percentage` = `0.1` then:

* 1 player - 20 items
* 2 players - 22 items
* 3 players - 24 items
* ...
* 10 players - 38 items
