 ![Fumos](https://files.catbox.moe/lrrq5g.webp "Fumos")

 The current list of fumos is as follows:

- Alice
- Aya
- Chen
- Cirno
- Clownpiece
- Eirin
- Eternity Larva
- Flandre
- Futo
- Inusakuya
- Junko
- Kaguya
- Kasen
- Keiki
- Kogasa
- Koishi
- Kokoro
- Marisa
- Medicine
- Meiling
- Mike
- Miko
- Mokou
- Momiji
- Nitori
- Nue
- Nyn (Nazrin)
- Patchouli
- Ran
- Reimu
- Reisen
- Remilia
- Rumia
- Sagume
- Sakuya
- Sanae
- Satori
- Seija
- Shikieiki
- Shinmyoumaru
- Shion
- Silhy
- Suika
- Suwako
- Tenshi
- Tewi
- Utsuho
- Youmu
- Yukari
- Yuuka
- Yuuma
- Yuyuko

All of these fumos are of varying levels of quality, as they are taken from user-submitted 3d Scans on SketchFab, or from private user submissions. Also, rumor has it that if you gather all 52 items in one place, you get to make a wish.

## Features

- All fumos are divided up between the four primary spawn lists (Generic, Manor, Wizard, and Arctic), and their values are adjusted to be close to or similar to vanilla valuables. 
- Most fumos are small-class items, but there are some tiny, medium, and big fumos, as well. 
- Some specific fumos have value and rarity adjusted based largely on a whim and because I thought it'd be appropriate (Mike is rarer and more valuable because Lucky Cat; Shion is less valuable because Poverty God, etc.).
- Some of the fumos have scripted behavior: Sakuya and Inusakuya have a similar effect to the vanilla hourglass valuable, slowing down time for the grabbing user, while Seija currently flips herself as soon as she is picked up.
- Most fumos have a sound specifically for when they are destroyed.
- All Fumos are optimized; Almost all of them were previously used in the Lethal Company mod, Fumo Company, and therefore have gone through several instances of optimization, both in decimation, and in texture size.
- All Fumos feature fully custom physics colliders and bounding boxes.


## WANTED: More Fumos!

I'm always willing to add more fumos; if you have one and don't mind 3d-scanning it (You can do this pretty easily with a mobile phone via any number of apps! I personally use Polycam, as I have a subscription.), you can upload them to sketchfab, and/or contact [Silhygames](https://discord.com/users/212736732540436483) directly in discord (if you do, please lead with more than 'hello' or similar in case discord deems you a bot), or via the [F.U.M.O. thread](https://discord.com/channels/1344557689979670578/1361461847425024020) in the [R.E.P.O. Modding discord](https://discord.gg/vPJtKhYAFe).
