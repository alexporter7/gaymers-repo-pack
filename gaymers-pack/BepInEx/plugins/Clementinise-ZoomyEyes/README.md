## What It Does:
ZoomyEyes gives you complete control over your character's pupils! Set your preferred default pupil size, from tiny contracted pupils to dramatically dilated ones. Plus, press a key (Z by default) to zoom your vision with synchronized pupil changes that other players can see in real-time, perfect for dramatic effects. üòè


## Features:
