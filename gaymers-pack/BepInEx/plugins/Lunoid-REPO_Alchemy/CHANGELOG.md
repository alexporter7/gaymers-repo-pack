### 1.1.0

- added REPOLib SDK stuff to use in the Unity Engine. adding content for this mod should be ***much*** easier (Thanks, Beanie!)
- added the ability to change the scale of objects within the pot
- added the ability to add existing objects as ingredients or products
- renamed "P.O.T." to "Alchemy P.O.T." so people know what mod its from


### 1.0.5

- fixed ingredients not transferring between levels


### 1.0.4

- fixed duplication/deletion glitches when storing an ingredient then immediately equipping the pot (hopefully)
- added a config to disable the pot in the shop
- the first three spawned ingredients now uses grab bag randomization (the first three spawned ingredients are be guaranteed to be varied. this will make getting duplicate ingredients rarer.)


### 1.0.3 

- fixed everything breaking when the prefabID and ingredientID aren't identical (damn void juice)


### 1.0.2

- scanned ingredients now highlight purple to differentiate from regular valuables
- ingredients no longer show up on the map until scanned
- fixed map markers appearing near the truck when the pot is equipped with ingredients stored
