Version 1.0.1:
     Rotated the meshes around as they were spawning backwards, which is kind of cool as you have to turn it around to see what you "pulled" but figured this was better
     Also gave the durability a small boost as they were a little TOO fragile and could not be put down easily to enjoy them
