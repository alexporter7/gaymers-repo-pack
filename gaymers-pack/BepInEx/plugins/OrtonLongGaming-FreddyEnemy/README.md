## WARNING
This mod contains loud noises, jumpscares, flashing lights and a whole lot of fun, fun, fun, fun fun!

# Are You Ready for Freddy?
The titular character from Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) has come to haunt your squad of lowly Semibots! This mod is inspired by the mechanics of Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery.

# How does he work?
Freddy Fazbear will wander around just like any other, but once he sees you, he'll go invisible and stalk you for a while.

He will then appear again, malfunctioning and haywiring like crazy, and heres what you have to do:
- Red Eyes: Look away!
- White Eyes: Stare!

If you're not quick enough, you'll be in for a scare!

# Not a fan of flashing lights?
The mod contains a config file where you can disable the flashing hallucination images when Freddy begins haywiring.
