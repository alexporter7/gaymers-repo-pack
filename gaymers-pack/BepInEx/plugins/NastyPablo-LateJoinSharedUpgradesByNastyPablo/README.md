# Late Join Shared Upgrades
The purpose of this mod is to allow players who join later in a game to receive the same upgrades as others instantly.

## **Important**
- This mod **assumes** that you use one of several "Shared Upgrades" mods.

- DOES NOT work with new modded upgrades. (MoreUpgrades mod gives the same option anyway)
### What this mod does exactly:
When the match start, it gets the Host upgrades count for each type of upgrade. 

Then for each player, gives the needed amount to reach the same upgrade count as the host for each type of upgrade.
