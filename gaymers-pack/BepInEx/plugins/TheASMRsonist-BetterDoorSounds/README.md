# BetterDoorSounds

This mod takes all the current door sounds (all maps now supported) and replaces them with better ones.

Requires REPOLib, SoundAPI, and the SoundAPI_REPO mods (this should fix some sounds being silent).

All sounds replaced include:
- Door opening and closing.
- Door slamming shut.
- Door closing shut.
- Door hinges breaking off.
- Door soft and hard hits.
- Door creak loops.

Future updates will include optimization fixes and/or other changes.
