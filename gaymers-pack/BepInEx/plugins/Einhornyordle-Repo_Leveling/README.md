# Repo Leveling

Tired of starting from scratch every time you get a game over in R.E.P.O.? What if every defeat could fuel your next
victory? Introducing Repo Leveling, a mod designed to transform R.E.P.O. from a rogue-like into a rogue-lite, providing
a sense of progression that keeps you coming back for more!

## Features

- **Total Haul Value:** Track the cumulative value of all items extracted during successful runs, turning every game
  over into a stepping stone for future success.
- **Skill Points (SP):** Skill Points are earned based on your Total Haul Value. Spend them to unlock permanent skills
  that enhance your gameplay.
- **Skills:** Gain permanent upgrades that apply immediately in your next run, giving you a head start right from the
  first level. Don't hesitate to spend them, as you can always redistribute your unlocked points if you want to change
  your strategy.
- **Skill Menu:** Your main hub for managing skills, featuring a statistics overview on the left and a skill point
  distribution section on the right. Access it easily via a new Skills button in the main menu and multiplayer lobby.
