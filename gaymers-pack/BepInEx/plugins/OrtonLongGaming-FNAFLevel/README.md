## Welcome back to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
Congratulations Semibots, you're now on the Fazbear's Fright collection team. It's your duty to explore the old abandoned Freddy Fazbear Pizzerias and retrieve whatever you can find inside.

But be careful. You're not alone.

# During the day, it's a place of joy..
This mod contains a brand new level to explore with friends, featuring rooms themed around multiple locations from the Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) series. Explore new FNAF rooms and valuables, and a few new mechanics along the way.

# But you aren't here during the day.
This mod is best used with the [FreddyEnemy](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/OrtonLongGaming/FreddyEnemy/) mod for the most immersive experience. 

## THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY STILL W.I.P. AND WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW MODULES, VALUABLES, AND MORE OVER TIME.
