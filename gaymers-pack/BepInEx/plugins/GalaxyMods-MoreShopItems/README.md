**Additional shopping shelves with increased shop loot**

## Features
- Increased item spawn rate in the shop.
- Additional shelving for more of each item.

## Important
There are a LOT of config entries that change values which can mess up item spawning, so I'd recommend leaving everything at it's default value. If you want to though, you can completely disable certain items. Be warned, disabling every item except health or upgrades seems to not work in the shop (I have no idea why).
- 'Max X In Shop' is not the total amount of item X, but rather the max amount of each item X it can spawn. For example, 'Max Upgrades In Shop = 10' will spawn 10 of each upgrade, not set the max amount of all upgrades to 10.
- 'Spawn Additional Shelving' needs to be the same value on everyone's config for it to work properly (if you want the additional shelf, ignore this config).
