# Gaymers Repo Pack

Just a mod pack made to play with friends

## Installing and Updating
When installing or updating the pack, make sure to create a **NEW** profile instead up updating the existing. It shouldn't cause problems but sometimes can cause issues when new mods are added and especially when mods are removed.

## Config Changes
As far as I'm aware, there isn't a way to include the very many configuration changes I've made to the pack. There are two things you can do
- Use the profile code included in each release
- Copy the config files from the github repo found here: https://github.com/alexporter7/gaymers-repo-pack

I put every change I make in the changelog and all older versions with their respective changes will be there
